## Project Title- **Analyzing using Facial Detection**
## **Problem Statement/Opportunity:**
* We can use this facial recognition system in identifying a particular person.
* Helps in grouping of many images of a single person
* It can helping providing security i.e facial recognition system for authentication
* Similar to the functionalities provided in Facebook or Google Photos, where one person once recognized, other images with the same person are automatically detected.
* It can be done by allocating a unique id to one personâ€™s face  when another image has face with similar features, the unique id helps detect new face
* With this we can compare to the previously detected faces, thus finding the match.

## **ProjectDescription:**
*  With  the help of API Key and endpoint we  canauthenticate  applications and start sending calls to the service.
* Try the service in the API console - requires API Key and selecting your location.
* The main aim of this project is  to deploy a  trained model with the help of **(Azure cognitive services)** .
* Its key functions are detecting faces ,analyzing facial features, and can identify if two faces  are similar to one another(validation).
* It can detect faces and facial features and analyze based on various parameters like (face ,smile,gender,glasses,emotion).
* Each face that is detected is assigned a unique ID by the system. We can check the Unique IDs for different faces detected in the image.
* Multitudes of facial attributes can be analyzed with the features provided by Cognitive Service.
*  Various emotional states from the facial features and expressions can be analyzed.
